# GOAT Coder Blog

This is a simple blog built with Gatsby.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Get Started

1. **Clone this repo onto your computer**

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/toddgoates/goatblog.git
   cd goatblog
   ```

1. **Preview Changes**

   Make your changes to the source code as needed. Note: blog posts are kept in `content/blog/`

   To see the changes in your browser, run `npm start`. This runs gatsby develop behind the scenes. When it is finished building, your site can be found at http://localhost:8000

   Because of hot reloading, you can save changes to the code and instantly see them in the browser without having to refresh the page.

   Note: You'll also see a second link when your code is done building: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).
